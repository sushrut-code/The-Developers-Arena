🎮 Video Games Sales & Ratings Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a massive dataset of video games to uncover trends in sales, platform popularity, and the relationship between critic scores and commercial success.

📂 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 64,016 records of video games with the following attributes:

Game Info: title, console (platform), genre, publisher, developer, release_date.

Performance Metrics:

critic_score: Aggregate score from critics.

total_sales(mil): Total global sales in millions.

Regional Sales (in millions):

na_sales(mil): North America.

jp_sales(mil): Japan.

pal_sales(mil): Europe/Africa (PAL region).

other_sales(mil): Other regions.

Data Cleaning:

Date Parsing: Converted release_date to datetime objects to enable time-series analysis.

Missing Values: The dataset originally contained significant missing data (e.g., ~57k missing critic scores, ~45k missing sales figures). These were handled (likely imputed or filled) to ensure statistical models and plots could run without errors, resulting in a clean dataset with 0 null values for the final analysis.

🔍 Key Insights & Analysis
1. 📊 Correlation Analysis
A correlation heatmap was generated to understand relationships between numerical variables. Key relationships typically explored in this domain include:

Critic Score vs. Sales: Investigating if higher critical acclaim actually leads to higher sales numbers.

Regional Correlations: Analyzing if success in North America (na_sales) correlates strongly with success in Europe (pal_sales) or Japan (jp_sales).

2. 🕹️ Platform (Console) Popularity
Distribution: A count plot was generated to visualize the number of games released per console (PS3, PS4, X360, etc.).

Insight: This highlights which consoles have the largest libraries and market presence over the dataset's timeframe.

3. 📈 Regional Sales Trends
The dataset breaks down sales by region, allowing for comparison of market preferences:

NA vs. JP vs. PAL: Identifying which genres or consoles perform better in specific parts of the world (e.g., JRPGs in Japan vs. Shooters in North America).

📊 Visualizations Generated
The notebook includes the following visualizations to communicate insights:

Correlation Heatmap: To visualize the strength of relationships between sales figures and scores.

Pairplot: A comprehensive grid of scatterplots to visualize pairwise relationships across all numerical variables.

Console Countplot: A bar chart showing the frequency of games across different gaming platforms.
