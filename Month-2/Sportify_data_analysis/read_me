🎵 Spotify Data Analysis -
Key Findings
This project explores a dataset of Spotify tracks to identify factors that influence popularity, analyze trends over time, and determine the impact of explicit content on song success.
📊 1. Data OverviewDataset 
  Size: 8,778 tracks with 15 features including popularity, duration, artist metadata, and explicit content flags.
  Data Cleaning:Handled missing values for track names, artist names, and genre data.Converted track duration from milliseconds to minutes for better readability.
  Standardized artist follower counts into millions.Extracted release years from date fields to analyze temporal trends.
📈 2. Exploratory Analysis InsightsPopularity DriversArtist 
  Influence: There is a moderate positive correlation (~0.46) between Artist Popularity and Track Popularity. 
  This suggests that while an artist's fame helps, the specific song's appeal is still a major factor.
  Track Duration: The analysis tracks the average song duration over the years, visualizing how industry standards for song length have evolved (typically showing a trend towards shorter songs in the streaming era).
  Content TrendsExplicit vs. Clean:The analysis identified the top artists producing explicit content.It also highlighted specific years where explicit content releases peaked, showing shifts in musical norms over time.
  Prolific Artists: Identified artists with the highest volume of tracks in the dataset, which helps distinguish between "viral hits" and consistent output.
  🧪 3. Statistical Hypothesis TestingA core part of this analysis was determining if explicit content affects a song's popularity.
  Test Performed: Independent T-TestHypothesis:$H_0$: There is no difference in popularity between explicit and non-explicit (clean) songs.$H_1$: There is a significant difference in popularity.Results:T-statistic: 12.18P-value: 0.00000 ( < 0.05 )
  Conclusion: The extremely low P-value allows us to reject the null hypothesis.
  Finding: There is a statistically significant difference in popularity between explicit and clean songs.
  Interpretation: Given the positive T-statistic (comparing Explicit vs. Clean), the data suggests that explicit songs tend to have higher popularity scores on average in this dataset compared to non-explicit ones.
  📝 Recommendations & Next StepsFor Artists: While explicit content correlates with higher popularity, it is likely confounded by genre (e.g., Hip-Hop/Rap being popular and often explicit). 
  Further segmentation by genre is recommended.
  Feature Engineering: The current moderate correlation (0.46) suggests other features (like danceability, energy, or tempo, if available) could better explain popularity variance.
