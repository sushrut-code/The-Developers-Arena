🍽️ Restaurant Tipping Analysis📌 
Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on restaurant tipping data to understand customer tipping behavior.
The goal is to identify factors that influence tip amounts, such as total bill size, party size, day of the week, and smoker status.
📂 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 244 records of restaurant transactions with the following features:
Total Bill: Cost of the meal (in dollars).
Tip: Tip amount (in dollars).
Sex: Gender of the payer (Male/Female).
Smoker: Whether the party included smokers (Yes/No).
Day: Day of the week (Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun).
Time: Meal time (Lunch/Dinner).
Size: Size of the party.
Feature Engineering:
tip_pct: Calculated as (tip / total_bill) * 100.
bill_per_head: Calculated as total_bill / size.
🔍 Key Insights & Conclusions1. 
📅 Busiest Days & TimesSaturday is the busiest day for the restaurant, followed by Sunday.
Dinner service is significantly more popular than Lunch, with the majority of transactions occurring in the evening.
2. 💰 Spending Habits
Highest Average Bill: Sunday Dinners have the highest average total bill ($21.41).
Lowest Average Bill: Friday Lunches have the lowest average total bill ($12.85).
Correlation: There is a strong positive correlation (0.67) between total_bill and tip. As the bill amount increases, the tip amount generally increases.
3. 💸 Tipping Behavior
Best Tippers (Percentage): Surprisingly, customers dining on Friday Lunch tend to leave the highest percentage tips (average 18.8%)
Worst Tippers (Percentage): Saturday Dinner crowds leave the lowest percentage tips (average 15.3%).
Bill Size vs. Tip %: There is a weak negative correlation (-0.33) between total_bill and tip_pct. This suggests that as the total bill gets larger, the percentage people tip tends to decrease slightly.
4. 🚬 Customer Demographics
Smokers: Saturday attracts the highest volume of smokers (42 tables), whereas Sunday has relatively few smokers compared to non-smokers.
Group Size: The largest average group sizes are seen during Sunday Dinner (avg 2.84 people).
📊 Statistical Analysis (Correlation Matrix)A correlation analysis was performed on the numerical features:
Observation: Party size is positively correlated with the bill amount (0.59), which is expected.
